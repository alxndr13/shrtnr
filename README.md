i got bored during my illness in december 2023 so i decided to fiddle around with htmx and write yet another link shortener. this code is hacked together in a few hours, so don't expect this repo to be an example for clean code or all the best practices ðŸ˜…

i may finish this README someday, for now everything you need to know should be in [./Taskfile.yaml](./Taskfile.yaml).
